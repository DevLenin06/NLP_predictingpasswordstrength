# Predicting Password Strength Model

## Overview
This model predicts the strength of passwords based on different features of each password. I accomplished this with the use of Natural Lnaguage Processing Techniques. This model uses Logistic Regression and was trained using a data containing a variety of passwords and their corresponding password strength.
